## One Time Conda Set Up in PACE

- By default, conda creates new environments in the home directory at ~/.conda. However, conda environments can be quite large, and the allotted home directory has a relatively small storage quota.
  
1. Log into PACE by running `ssh gburdell3@login-ice.pace.gatech.edu` (substitute your email). This will prompt you to log in using your GT password.
2. First, check to see if you have an existing `~/.conda` directory or symlink by running:
    - `file ~/.conda`
3. If `file ~/.conda` reports "No such file or directory":
    1. Create a `.conda` directory in your scratch folder by running:
        - `mkdir ~/scratch/.conda`
    2. Then, create a symlink from your scratch folder to your home directory:
        - `ln -s ~/scratch/.conda ~/.conda`

4. If `file ~/.conda` reports that `~/.conda` is a directory, then:
    1. Move your `.conda` directory to your scratch space:
        - `mv ~/.conda ~/scratch/`
    2. Create a symlink from your project space to your home directory:
        - `ln -s ~/scratch/.conda ~/.conda`

## How to Use Environment in PACE

1. Follow the one-time setup to create a conda symlink.
2. Log into PACE by running `ssh gburdell3@login-ice.pace.gatech.edu` (substitute your email). This will prompt you to log in using your GT password.
3. Go to the root of the project and run `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
4. This will create an environment called `DL_ASLR_ENV`. Activate this environment by running:
    - `conda activate DL_ASLR_ENV`
5. Load Anaconda by running:
    - `module load anaconda3/2022.05.0.1`
6. Deactivate any environment (if you are in base or any other). Activate your environment by running:
    - `activate DL_ASLR_ENV`

You're now ready to run the project!

## How to Run the Project

1. **Navigate to the Project Root:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Change directory to the root of your project where `train_model.py` is located.

2. **Modify Model and Experiment Names in `train_model.py`:**
   - Open `train_model.py` in a text editor of your choice.

   **Update Model Name:**
   - Look for the section where the model is defined.
   - Change the model name to one of the available options:
     - NN (Neural Network)
     - CNN (Convolutional Neural Network )
     - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory )

   **Specify Experiment Name:**
   - Locate the part of the script where the experiment name is set.
   - Replace the existing experiment name with your desired name.

3. **Run the Training Script:**
   - In the terminal, execute the following command to start training:
     ```bash
     python3 train_model.py
     ```

   **Monitor Training Progress:**
   - The script will display training accuracy and loss per epoch as it runs.
   - Upon completion, it will print the final test accuracy and loss.
   - A graph depicting the training process will be generated and saved.

4. **Review Results:**
   - After training completes, analyze the results and graphs generated by `train_model.py`.
   - Adjust parameters and rerun as needed based on your experiment objectives.
